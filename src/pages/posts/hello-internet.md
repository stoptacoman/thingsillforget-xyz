It took me the longest time to get to this point. I cannot tell you how many false starts I have had with trying to get a blog up and running. To the point that I let the original domain name (RIP thingsillforget.com) lapse without ever having left the ground. Throughout my attempts since ~2017 I've gone from from trying the following more traditional blogging platforms:

- Drupal
- Wordpress
- Joomla

To attempts at rolling my own blogging platforms with some fullstack frameworks:

- Ruby on Rails
- Django

The reasons for never following through with making the blog varied over time. Reasons from a lack of motivation and focus -- I was diagnosed with ADHD in early 2021 and in retrospect I have more than likely had it my whole life -- to lack of time -- I've gone from have **zero** kids to **two** since 2017. Another reason that plagued me over time is my constant struggle with perfectionism and setting unrealistic goals for myself and my projects. I'll give you an example:

> _Initially I set out to learn how to use one of the PHP-based blogging platforms with the intention of building my own themes and host it on a Digital Ocean droplet. Eventually, my lack of focus kicked I took on too many tasks at once and became overwhelmed and lost motivation. My complete lack of focus and motivation led me into the thinking trap of 'Whelp, I can't get this done exactly way I want it to be, so I just won't bother doing it at all. My overall vision is king and if I cannot meet those standards, then I will choose to just not try._

The goal today is ultimately the same as it always was: learn how to use a blogging platform and the underlying programming language -- Astro and JavaScript in this case -- required to create said blog. All while trying to improve on my web design skills. Why is it so different this time? Well for starters I'm writing this now after I spent the last 3 hours building out the skeleton of a website whilst leaning on Astro's decent amount of documentation. This was made possible after having spent the bulk of 2022 so far minimally learning JavaScript front-end frameworks in much smaller bites than I would have previously. As I became more familiar with concepts of props and UI components the more something like Astro just makes sense to me. Its APIs are not overly complex and hard to understand and the documentation is clear enough for me to read through (and I've read through it A LOT). Even now I don't feel like this is _THE_ site that I want it to be and that's okay. It doesn't have to be.
