You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? What? Well that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh? Damn. I'm late for school. No, bastards.

Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? What, what? Just say anything, George, say what ever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind. Doc? That's good advice, Marty.

I've gotta go. Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire? That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean.

I think I know exactly what you mean. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. Lorraine. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.

I haven't Marty you gotta come back with me. I think I know exactly what you mean. You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. George. George.

Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing on the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einy, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it. The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style. Besides, the stainless, steel construction made the flux dispersal- look out.
